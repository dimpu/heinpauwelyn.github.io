On **monday and tuesday** I've done some research about WebVR, now I know that WebVR uses JavaScript, HTML and CSS on the frontend. This uses an API that render the screen. I've found the three pros of WebVR are distribution, cross-platform and direct. The const of WebVR is that the rendering of new frames is verry slow.

**Tuesday** was the first day I worked by Poppr and meet the team. 

On **wensday** I've visiting Batibouw. No not because I'll build a house but because there were several exhibition stands with a VR experiance. I've visiting some stands (among other things Niko and Velux) and tried there VR and 360Â° experiance.

**Thursday** I develop on this site. I've added Angular-CLI and translated it to English. I've also develop on the internship page.
